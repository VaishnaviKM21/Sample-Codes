## STATA Codes

1. **Thesis Model Code**  
   This code is part of my thesis on classifying vulnerable workers in India and studying the wage gap, mobility, and sorting into labor markets. Using cleaned **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** data, the code implements various methods, including **matching techniques**, **Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition**, and **multinomial logit models**.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   This code performs an exploratory analysis of female labor force participation trends in Madhya Pradesh. I demonstrate skills such as data preparation, graphical analysis, and implementing Fixed effects models.

3. **RCT Randomisation**  
   This do-file implements randomization techniques for a **Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** examining interventions to improve latrine usage in rural India, focusing on religious stigma and health awareness using **MIS** and **NFHS** data.

4. **Time Series Code â€“ VAR Model**  
   This code models the relationship between the **Index of Industrial Production (IIP)** and the **unemployment rate** using a **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** model, analyzing both urban and rural unemployment and finding bidirectional effects and greater volatility in rural unemployment.
