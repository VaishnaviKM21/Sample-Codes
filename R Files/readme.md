## R Files

1. **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**  
   This R markdown performs **Propensity Score Matching** using data on **firms in Myanmar** to examine whether exporting firms in low-income countries have worse labor conditions (pay, hours, safety). The analysis was part of a Stats class and is inspired by the paper: Tanaka, Mari (2020), "Exporting Sweatshops? Evidence from Myanmar," *Review of Economics and Statistics*.

2. **Mahalanobis Distance**  
   This R markdown calculates the **Mahalanobis Distance** to assess homogeneity between treatment and control groups after randomization. This ensures comparability for further analysis, following the RCT process described in the STATA do-file.

3. **Principal Component Analysis**
  This R Markdown document performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on variables related to investment and expenditure in rural India. Using six variables from the All India Debt and Investment Survey, the analysis includes correlation analysis, PCA, and various methods for selecting the components to retain.
